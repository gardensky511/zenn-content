## 3. "use client" とは

> The "use client" directive is a convention to declare a boundary between a Server and Client Component module graph.

> "use client" does not need to be defined in every file. The Client module boundary only needs to be defined once, at the "entry point", for all modules imported into it to be considered a Client Component.
